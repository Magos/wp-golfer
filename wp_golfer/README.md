# wp_golfer

A utility for wikipedia golf, made as a teach-myself-Clojure project. 
Wikipedia golf is a game for any number of players in which one Wikipedia article is chosen as the tee and one as the hole. 
The winner is the player who finds the shortest path from the tee to the hole, where all navigation is done by clicking article links.
Obviously, using a brute-force breadth-first search as this does is kind of cheating, as the intended purpose is to be a test of knowledge and creative connection-building.
Therefore, the recommended application is for referees to use this to find difficult courses.
